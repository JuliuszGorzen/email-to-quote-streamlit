Here you will find the approaches that we consider to be the most promising for the *"Email to Quote"* project.

**Tabs:**

Each tab below consists of a different approach. You can navigate through them by clicking on the tabs.
Within each tab, you will find a description of the approach and a form to test it.

**Sidebar:**

On the left side of the screen, you will find the sidebar. It contains the model parameters form and the logout button.
Each filed is described in the form, so you can easily fill it in.

**Login:**

Once you log in the credentials will be stored in the cookie for one day, so you don't have to log in every time you 
visit the app.

The source code of the app is available on
[Transporeon Gitlab](https://gitlab.office.transporeon.com/juliusz.gorzen/email-to-quote-streamlit) or [Juliusz Gorzen Github](https://github.com/JuliuszGorzen/email-to-quote-streamlit)
