### Description :pencil2:

NER - Named entity recognition (NER) is a natural language processing (NLP) method that extracts information from text. 
NER involves detecting and categorizing important information in text known as named entities.

Zero-shot learning refers to the ability to complete a task without having received any training examples. 
Consider the case of recognizing a category of object in images without ever having seen a photo of that type of 
object. You might be able to determine what a cat is in an image the first time you see it if youâ€™ve read a really 
comprehensive description of it.
